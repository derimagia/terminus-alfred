# Terminus Alfred

Very much inital work.

1) Currently using Terminus from PATH so terminus is required.
2) Doesn't do anything interesting yet.

## TODO

1) Make useful.
2) See if we can remove dependency on PATH and use terminus as library. Issue is we still want to do the trick we are doing to load the user's default shell.
3) Performance beenfits. We'd need to use terminus as a library at this point. 
4) Remove dependency to alfred-workflow or recreate it.
